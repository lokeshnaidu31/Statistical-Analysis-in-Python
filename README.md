# Statistical-Analysis-in-Python
Statistical analysis is a fundamental aspect of data science and machine learning. By understanding and applying statistical methods, you can derive meaningful insights from datasets, make predictions, and inform decision-making

# Heart Disease Prediction: Linear Regression Analysis

This project explores the relationship between various health indicators (e.g., age, blood pressure) and cholesterol levels. We use Python libraries such as **pandas**, **statsmodels**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** to conduct regression analysis and visualize the data. The goal is to understand the significant predictors of cholesterol levels using a linear regression model.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting a linear regression analysis to explore the relationships between health indicators such as:
- **Age**
- **Blood Pressure (BP)**

and the **Cholesterol** level of individuals. We aim to determine which variables significantly impact cholesterol levels using hypothesis testing, and build visualizations to illustrate the relationships.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is **Heart Disease Prediction**, which includes several health attributes like:
- Age
- Gender
- Chest Pain Type
- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Exercise Angina
- ST Depression, etc.

The target variable is **Cholesterol**, which is predicted using other health-related features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

## Regression Analysis

We performed a linear regression analysis with the following steps:

1. Load the dataset using `pandas`.
2. Select **Age** and **Blood Pressure (BP)** as independent variables.
3. Use **Cholesterol** as the dependent variable.
4. Fit a linear regression model using `statsmodels`.
5. Interpret the model's coefficients, p-values, and R-squared value.

The regression analysis results help identify which features have a significant impact on cholesterol levels.

## Visualization

Visualizations were created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to illustrate the relationships between:
- **Age and Cholesterol**
- **BP and Cholesterol**

These visualizations include scatter plots with fitted regression lines to demonstrate the strength of the relationships.

## Results

- **Age** and **Blood Pressure** were found to have statistically significant relationships with **Cholesterol**, though the overall model had a low **R-squared** value (indicating that other factors may contribute to cholesterol levels).
- A detailed interpretation of the regression coefficients, p-values, and visualizations is available in the `Statistical Analysis in Python.ipynb` file.
